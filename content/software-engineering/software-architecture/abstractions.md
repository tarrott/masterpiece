## Functional Abstraction


## Data Abstraction
- high-level: use only the set of basic operations to manipulate the data abstraction
- lower-level: define the basic set of operations that can express all manipulations of a data abstraction
- loewest level: implement constructors and selectors with native data types


## Abstraction Barriers
- maintain abstraction barriers and avoid violations in order to make it easier to modify and maintain the program
- functions that are defined in terms of the basic set of operations on a data abstraction do not need to be updated when the underlying implementation of the data abstraction changes

## Notes
- see chapter 2.2 of *Composing Programs* for more information
