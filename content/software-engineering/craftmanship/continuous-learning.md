"Take time to retrospect the challenges that you solve in production systems. Ask yourself:"

- Knowing what I know now, would I approach the problem differently?
- What was missing in our monitoring or logging to catch this issue?
- Is this an anomaly — but still useful for my learning?

"When you find something concrete, share what you’ve learned. Our team uses a #til (Today I Learned) Slack channel to capture these little nuggets of learning. It might also be helpful to capture them learnings in the project’s README for future developers."
