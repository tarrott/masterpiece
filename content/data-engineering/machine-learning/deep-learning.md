## Neural Networks

### Feed Forward

#### Perceptron
1. Sum of all inputs multiplied by their weight, then added to a bias
2. Activation function (feed forward)


### Back Propogation in Supervised Learning
- goal: reduce the cost function
- calculate the cost in by substracting the output estimate (neural network's guess) from the actual guess
